EXERCISE

Create a dashboard with 3-5 pages showing different trends. 
We are interested in finding/exploring correlations between quality levels and sensor readings.

- Assume that the quality level for an acceptable item is between 350 and 450. If an item has quality level 
below 350, this is a defect. If the quality level is above 450, then it is waste.
Create columns called "defect" and "waste" in the quality table that takes values "yes"/"no".

Some ideas:
- Charts per day of the week or per hour
- KPI charts, Graphical charts
- Average sensor readings, perhaps some statistical plots (boxplot, summary tables).
==> Add some navigation features (button on text area, bookmarks) and different types of filters.
