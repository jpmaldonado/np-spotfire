The data in the folder `data/neiss` contains:

	- Number of cases by gender.
	- Most common locations for injury (Top 5).
	- Least common locations for injury (Bottom 5).
	- Most common body part injury (Top 5).
- On a new page, create a visualization showing number of cases by age and gender.
- Add, on the same page as above, two details visualization showing:
	- Most common locations for injury (Top 5).
	- Most common body part injury (Top 5).
	
### Exercise 2 - Multiple data sources and column operations	
- Load the `injuries.csv`, `products.csv` and `population.csv` files.
- Create visualizations showing:
