## NEISS
The data in the folder `data/neiss` contains:

- Reports from emergency room cases (`injuries.csv`).
- Information about the products involved in those cases (`products.csv`).
- Population statistics (`population.csv`). 

### Exercise 1 - One data source and details visualization
Load the `injuries.csv` file. Create visualizations showing:
- Number of cases by age.
- Number of cases by gender.
- Most common locations for injury (Top 5).
- Least common locations for injury (Bottom 5).
- Most common body part injury (Top 5).

On a new page:
- Create a visualization showing number of cases by age and gender.
- Add, on the same page as above, two details visualization showing:
	- Most common locations for injury (Top 5).
	- Most common body part injury (Top 5).
	
### Exercise 2 - Multiple data sources and column operations	
Load the `injuries.csv`, `products.csv` and `population.csv` files. Create visualizations showing:
- The 3 most common products involved, per age and gender.
- The incidence rate of injuries in the population.

### Exercise 3 - Flight Delays
Using the `flight-delays` file, use visualizations to show:
- Total Delay (Arrival + Departure Delay)
- Total Delay by Airline
- Variation of Total Delay per Time	
	
### Exercise 4 - Pivot and unpivot
Calculate, using the `adult` data set, a pivot table with columns:
- Work class.
- Number of people with income > 50k.
- Number of people with income <= 50k.
- Number of people.

Calculate, using the `experiments` data set, an unpivoted table that shows the columns:
- Code.
- Test.
- Status (OK, KO or NA).

### Exercise 5 - Wine Classification
- Create a classification model that classifies wine per category.
- Visualize the different classes of wines according to their numerical attributes.
